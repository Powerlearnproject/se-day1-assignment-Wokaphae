Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering 
Application of engineering principles to the  development, operation and maintenanance of software sysytems. It is important as it enables creation of software that
powers various aspects of modern day life like communication and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages example Fortan
Establishment of software engineering as discipline.
The advent of structured programming
The rise of agile methodologies.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Gathering and documenting the needs of the user ans systenm requirements 
Designing the software architecture and user interface
Implemetation whereby you write the code and build software according to design specifications
Testing to ensure that it meets the standards and  the functional requirements
Deployment to customers 
Maintenance where providing support, updates and enhancement to ensure optimal perfomance



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a software development methodology that uses a sequential approach with distinct phases, it has a flow to it lmost like a waterfall while Agile uses  an iterative and incremental  approacch
 and is focused on flexibility, collaboration and adapting to change. An example of a scenario where the Waterfall method might be appropriate is banking software while the agile method might be more well 
 suited in development of a new social media app.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software development.
A Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
A Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
These software engineering tools enhance productivity, collaboration, and code quality by providing developers with features such as code editors, version control, debugging tools, and automated testing capabilities.
Examples IDEs, Visual Studio. VCS, Git. 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements and this can be solved by agile development 
Tight Deadlines which can be solved by priotizing tasks 
Technical debt which can be solved by clearly analyzing a project and knowing all its needs before taking it on.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing where individual components of software are tested. This is important because it allows for early bug detection and simpler debugging as bugs are localized.
Intergration testing. This checks for how modules interact with one another ans ensures data flows correctly between integrated  modules. It helps with problems 
when connecting different sofware components.
System testing validates the entire application by checking if it meets the functional and non functional requirements and is performed in a realistic environment. It is important as
it determines whether software is ready for production.
Acceptance testing evaluates whetether software meets business requiremments  and if it is ready for deployment. Often it is done by end users. It confirms whether software meets user expectations.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crating questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. It helps us avoid vagueness in the responses we get from these models helping us save time and improve productivity.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: Write about cars.
Improved Prompt: Write a 300-word aricle about cars discussing the evolution of engines over the past 20 years highlighting key changes in fuel requirements and improvement in power output.
The second prompt is specific as it focuses on not cars but engines.
It is clear as it gives both time and specific topics to focus on.
It is concise as it specifies the exact amount of words to be used in the article.
It has no grammatical or logical errors hence ensures correctness.
